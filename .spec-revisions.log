Document: specification/4_QUERIES.md
Section: 20. MATCH Statement
Problem: Specification states "RETURN clause is required" but implementation adds compound MATCH statements (MATCH...LINK/SET/KILL/UNLINK) that don't require RETURN because they perform mutations instead of returning query results
Evidence: PR #25 implements MatchMutateStmt that allows MATCH followed by mutation keywords without RETURN clause. This is a legitimate language extension, not a specification error.

Resolution:
- Updated section 20.2 note to clarify RETURN is required for query MATCH but not for compound MATCH
- Updated section 20.2.1 table to add "Compound Statement" context
- Added new section 2.11 "Compound MATCH Statements" documenting syntax, semantics, examples, and differences from subquery mutations
- Updated section 2.12 AST to include MatchMutateStmt interface

Propagated to: specification/4_QUERIES.md (complete)
Hierarchy check: 1_LANGUAGE.md does not specify MATCH/RETURN behavior - no higher-level changes needed

Section: LinkStmt AST definition
Problem: Implementation adds if_not_exists: bool field for LINK IF NOT EXISTS syntax, but spec doesn't include it
Evidence: PR implements LINK IF NOT EXISTS feature, spec/impl mismatch discovered during review

Section: MutationOp grammar and AST
Problem: Implementation allows SPAWN in compound MATCH...SPAWN...LINK statements, but spec only lists link/unlink/set/kill
Evidence: PR adds Spawn to MutationAction enum, spec/impl mismatch discovered during review
Resolution: Added ifNotExists: boolean field to LinkStmt AST definition
Propagated to: None needed (implementation already has this field)

Resolution: Added "spawn" SpawnExpr to MutationOp grammar and "Spawn" to MutationOp AST kind union
Propagated to: None needed (implementation already has this variant)
